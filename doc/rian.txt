0. Foreword					                           *rian-foreword*

This help document was made to help me reinforce some of the things I've
learned while reading 'Practical Vim, Second Edition' by Drew Neil.

	source: https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition

Each section will represent a chapter in the book. Not everything I learn and
write down will have been sourced directly from the book; some things will
a result of being triggered by something else I've read or learned. I will
write it down in either case, as that will be a proper record of my
experience.

Hopefully if someone reads this, they will be inspired to buy and read the
book for themselves, as it has been quite a good read for me so far.

For example, not until today did I ever think about writing `:help` documents
for myself!

1. Chapter 1, The Vim Way                              *rian-ch1*

:help <topic>
:h <topic>
					A shortcut for `:help` is `:h`.

$HOME/<user>/desktop
~/<user>/desktop
		            A shortcut for $HOME is `~`
				    I knew this, but never thought to try it

<C-X>
			        The notation for CTRL-X (for example), is <C-X>
				    Another thing I should know, but haven't solidified

t
					The representation of the text object
					for an html {tag}

vim -u NONE
					To start Vim with no .vimrc enabled

vim -u filename.vim
					To start Vim with a custom .vimrc
					file specified by the user

>{motion}
					The '>' command also accepts a {motion}, much like other
					actions. Never occurred to me to try anything other than
					'>>' or {Visual}>

cl
					Amazingly, this is synonymous with s. This is less a
					useful tip, as it is just a surprise to me that using l as
					a motion for a command has never occurred to me.

S
					This is equivalent to ^C, which means replace whole line
					starting from the first non-blank character

@:					Repeat the last {Ex} command. Interestingly, the reason
					this works is because, once executed, Ex commands are
					written to the ':' register, and @: invokes it like a
					macro! `wow`

&					Repeat the last {substitute} command, keeping no flags.
					This sucks when @: exists.

:&&					Repeat the last {substitute} command, keeping all flags.
					This sucks when @: exists.

&g					Repeat the last {substitute} command for all lines in rest
					of file, keeping all flags.
